<p>Nearly 200 million years ago, one species of sauropodomorph&#x2014;those long-necked, herbivorous dinosaurs known to grow to great sizes&#x2014;nested its eggs at a site near what has become southern China's Yunnan Province. Periodically, the nests were destroyed by floods, washing away all but some of the eggs and the tiny bones they contained.</p>

<p>Today, this rare jumble of embryonic bones&#x2014;some as thin as pencil lead&#x2014;gives an unprecedented look at dinosaur embryos at various stages of development. Examining cross-sections of 24 different femurs from the species (probably of the genus <italic>Lufengosaurus</italic>), a team led by paleontologist Robert Reisz of the University of Toronto, Mississauga, in Canada observed a high proportion of vascular space inside the bones (pictured), indicating that these embryos grew extremely quickly&#x2014;faster than any other known dinosaur and all living birds. This rapid embryonic development may have been the key to adult sauropodomorphs' towering physiques, the team reports online this week in <italic>Nature</italic>.</p>
<p>The bone bed is a "spectacular find," because it offers a look at how the species grew over time, something no single embryo can do, says Luis Chiappe, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County in California.</p>
