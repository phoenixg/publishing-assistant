<p>When an electric current <italic>I</italic> flows through a slab of conductor placed in an external magnetic field <italic>H</italic> perpendicular to the flow direction, the magnetic field deflects the current-carrying charge particles toward the edge of the conductor and a transverse voltage <italic>V</italic><sub>T</sub> develops across the sample. This effect, discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>), is called the Hall effect. Because the transverse resistance (or Hall resistance) defined as <italic>V</italic><sub>T</sub>/<italic>I</italic> is proportional to <italic>H/n</italic>, where <italic>n</italic> is the sheet carrier density of the sample, the Hall effect has been widely used to quantify the carrier type (electron or hole), density, and mobilities of electronic materials. However, in the 1980s it was found that when the charge carriers are confined to a two-dimensional system (or sheet), the Hall resistance becomes exactly quantized at <italic>h</italic>/(<italic>&#x03BD;e</italic><sup>2</sup>), where <italic>h</italic> is the Planck constant, <italic>e</italic> is the electron charge, and <italic>&#x03BD;</italic> is a positive integer, whenever <italic>H/n</italic> approaches specific values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>).

<p>Numbers in parentheses indicate the years of each discovery. H is the external magnetic field, and M is the magnetization. For all three quantum Hall effects, electrons flow through the lossless edge channels, with the rest of the system insulating. When there is a net forward flow of electrons for Hall resistance measurement, (<bold>left</bold>) those extra electrons occupy only the left edge channels in the quantum Hall system regardless of their spins, (<bold>center</bold>) opposite-spin electrons occupy opposite sides in the quantum spin Hall system, and (<bold>right</bold>) only spin-down electrons flow through the left edge in the quantum anomalous Hall system. The locking schemes between spin and flow direction, and the number of edge channels depend on the material details, and only the simplest cases are illustrated here.</p>

<p>Soon after the discovery of the QHE, it was realized that the quantization occurs when dissipationless (or lossless) one-dimensional channels form around the edges of the sheet while the rest of the sample remains insulating and that the number of these edge channels determines the integer value <italic>&#x03BD;</italic>. In such a case, electrons flowing on one side cannot be scattered backward because the backward channels exist only on the other side of the sample, which is separated by the insulating bulk in between, and whenever quantization occurs in the transverse resistance, the longitudinal resistance of the sample reduces to zero.</p>
<p>As understanding of the QHE matured, questions arose as to whether such lossless edge channels could exist even in the absence of an external magnetic field. In 1988, it was shown theoretically that such an edge channel can exist on a two-dimensional lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Then, almost 20 years later, experimental demonstration of the presence of lossless edge channels in a HgTe/CdTe quantum well in the absence of an external magnetic field was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). However, due to the absence of a magnetic field forcing the current to flow one way or the other, there existed both clockwise and counter-clockwise edge channels, whose direction was determined by the spin orientation (either up or down) of the occupying electrons, forced by the strong spin-orbit coupling mechanism inherent in heavy elements. This is the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), a quantized version of the spin Hall effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>If one of the spin channels in the QSH system is suppressed&#x2014;for example, by ferromagnetism&#x2014;it naturally leads to the QAHE. The Hall resistance in ferromagnetic conductors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>) is composed of the ordinary Hall effect proportional to the magnetic field and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) proportional to the magnetization of the sample; the QAHE is the quantized version of this AHE. The discovery of the QSHE spurred active searches for the QAHE. It was proposed that the QAHE may be observable by suppressing one of the spin channels in the QSH state of the HgTe system with magnetic doping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Unfortunately, this system does not become ferromagnetic and thus failed to exhibit the QAHE. It was later predicted that when a topological insulator Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> is made thin and magnetically doped, the system should exhibit the QAHE with a quantized Hall resistance of <italic>h/e</italic><sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>)&#x2014;a proposal that Chang <italic>et al.</italic> have successfully implemented.</p>
<p>There were nontrivial material problems that Chang <italic>et al.</italic> had to overcome. The QAHE requires, among other things, bulk and surface conduction to be completely suppressed. However, the proposed Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> system has highly electron-doped bulk and surface states due to unavoidable selenium vacancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). To get around this problem, they instead chose the (Bi<sub>1&#x2212;x</sub>Sb<sub>x</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>), which, with the choice of x, allows tuning of its doping level toward the doping-neutral point, where ferromagnetism opens an energy gap. With optimization of the material parameters, they achieved the quantized Hall resistance of <italic>h/e</italic><sup>2</sup> at around the doping-neutral point in the absence of an external magnetic field.</p>
<p>The observed properties of the QAHE are robust. First of all, unlike the QSHE, which required submicrometer feature sizes to avoid spin-flip scattering, the QAHE was observed over a macroscopic scale of hundreds of micrometers. It is also intriguing that the exact quantization is achieved even on a platform with a relatively low mobility and with nonzero bulk conduction. This implies that the QAHE is definitely more robust than the QSHE and could be comparable to or even more resilient than the QHE.</p>
<p>The exact quantization of the observed QAHE and the presence of a lossless edge channel could be used for a number of applications. For example, the edge channel could be used as a dissipationless spin-filtering path for spintronic devices, and the exactly quantized Hall resistance without any magnetic field could be used as a simple resistance standard. The reported platform is yet far from such applications, considering the extremely low temperature requirement, currently enforced by the low ferromagnetic Curie temperature and other material imperfections. However, with further material breakthroughs, QAHE components might someday find their places in our mobile electronic devices.</p>
