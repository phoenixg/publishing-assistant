<p>Earth&apos;s oceans, plants, and soils suck up about half of the carbon dioxide humans put in the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. Without these carbon sinks operating at their usual pace, the additional greenhouse gas would make global warming even stronger. But the warming itself could be throwing a monkey wrench in the works by stressing plants and slowing their uptake of carbon dioxide. Some researchers have in fact reported a worrying slowing of carbon dioxide uptake in one part of the globe or another.</p>
<p>In this week&apos;s issue of <italic>Nature</italic>, however, a group reports that the planet&apos;s carbon sinks are on the whole doing just fine. The researchers calculated how much carbon has been going into sinks by subtracting the amount remaining in the atmosphere from the amount emitted over the past 50 years. In that time, global carbon uptake doubled to 5 billion tons per year&#x2014;keeping pace with humans&apos; growing input&#x2014;so that about 55% of emissions continues to be stored. That&apos;s reassuring but says nothing about the future vitality of the world&apos;s carbon sinks.</p>
