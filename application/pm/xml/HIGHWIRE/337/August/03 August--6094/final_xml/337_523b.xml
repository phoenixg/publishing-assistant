<p>I hope that <italic>Science</italic> continues to report the quantitative evidence from National Institutes of Health (NIH) investigators of widespread bias in the NIH grant review process against black scientists (&#x201C;Action urged to curb racial bias in NIH grants,&#x201D; M. Price, News &amp; Analysis, 22 June, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="336" page="1490" issue="6088">1490</related-article>). Giving attention to the extensive nature of unfair discrimination experienced by many black scientists&#x2014;from their entry into science education, through their training, to the end of their under-supported careers&#x2014;is one means of reducing, and perhaps one day eradicating, this form of racism. The article quotes NIH Director Francis Collins as saying, &#x201C;To have this circumstance continue&#x2026;is simply unacceptable.&#x201D; If NIH is sincere about reducing destructive racial bias in its grant review process, its director must first recognize that this stain on NIH is more than just a &#x201C;circumstance.&#x201D; Given its widespread documentation throughout the NIH, racial bias is inherent in NIH review process itself.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that NIH, or its invited reviewers, will ever give up the anonymity of the review process, which would be the most effective single action for reducing racial bias. Therefore, the NIH director and administrative staff must alter and augment the review process in other ways that reduce racial bias and its immediate fallout. I propose three steps forward: (i) Provide well-designed, NIH-relevant, racial bias awareness training required of all reviewers before review sessions. (ii) Require the same training for all NIH-funded investigators and trainees annually. (iii) Establish an effective reparative support fund that provides research support to black applicants who can show evidence of racial discrimination based on statistical analyses of success rates and/or racially biased comments in grant review summary statements.</p>
