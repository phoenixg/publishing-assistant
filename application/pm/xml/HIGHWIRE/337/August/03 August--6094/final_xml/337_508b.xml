<p>During one week in March 2011, Kevin Thomas, a toxicologist at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research in Oslo, and colleagues collected daily samples representing 24 hours of sewage flow from 21 sewage treatment plants in 19 cities across Europe in order to find out how much of certain illicit drugs people in those cities consume. The samples were analyzed for traces of five different drugs.</p>

<p>In the study, published in <italic>Science of the Total Environment</italic>, the researchers found that while cannabis consumption appeared to be similar throughout Europe, cocaine use per capita was highest in Belgium and other parts of west and central Europe, while methamphetamine levels per capita were highest in Scandinavian cities and Budweis in the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Some of the peaks may be due to drug production rather than consumption, Thomas cautions. Another source of uncertainty is that much is still unclear about drug metabolism in the body, says Fritz S&#x00F6;rgel, head of the Institute for Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Research in Nuremberg, Germany, who was not involved in the work. The authors assumed that on average, 38% of a cocaine dose is excreted. &#x201C;How good that value really is still needs to be shown,&#x201D; S&#x00F6;rgel says. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scim.ag/flushdrugs"><bold>http://scim.ag/flushdrugs</bold></ext-link></p>
