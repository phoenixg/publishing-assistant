<p><bold>Letters:</bold> &#x201C;Good news for European vultures&#x201D; by A. Margalida <italic>et al.</italic> (20 January, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="335" page="284-a" issue="6066">284</related-article>). The Letter incorrectly stated: &#x201C;In Spain alone, avian scavengers are capable of removing 9.9 million tons of carcasses per year.&#x201D; The correct figure is 9.9 thousand tons.</p>
<p><bold>Reports:</bold> &#x201C;Disentangling the drivers of &#x03B2; diversity along latitudinal and elevational gradients&#x201D; by N. J. B. Kraft <italic>et al.</italic> (23 September 2011, p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="333" page="1755" issue="6050">1755</related-article>). An error was made when tabulating the number of individuals in the latitudinal data set; as a result, the median number of individuals in a subplot was reported as 31.4 instead of 35.3. This affects the application of the null model to the latitudinal data set (Fig. 3, A and C), as the null model randomizes individuals. This causes minor changes to the expected &#x03B2; diversity values in Fig. 3A, but no change to the central result that much of the relation between &#x03B2; diversity and latitude is expected under the null model. Dividing the difference between observed and expected &#x03B2; diversity (Fig. 3A) by the standard deviation of the null model yields the &#x03B2; deviation (Fig. 3C). In the corrected data set (shown below) there is a weak negative relation between the &#x03B2; deviation and latitude (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) but, as in the initial analysis, the relation has very little explanatory power (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.03). Most important, 94% of the variance explained by the original &#x03B2; diversity-latitude relation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.54) is removed by the null model. This has no impact on conclusions of the report. This also affects the &#x03B2; deviation values discussed in the related Technical Comment and Technical Response (30 March 2012, p. 1573), although likewise it has no impact on the conclusions.</p>
