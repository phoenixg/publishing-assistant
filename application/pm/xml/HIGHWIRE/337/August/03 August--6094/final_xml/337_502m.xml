<p>Invasive species have been integrated into ecosystems worldwide, and in many cases can cause significant ecological and economic damage. Not all non-native species, however, become invasive species; thus there has been much effort put toward understanding what makes a non-native &#x201C;colonizer&#x201D; an invader. It has been thought that, in general, successful invaders tend to be those that produce a large amount of offspring over a very short period of time, however, this pattern is absent in many successful invaders. <bold>Sol <italic>et al.</italic></bold> (p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="580">580</related-article>) looked at over 2700 invasions by bird species across the world and found no relationship between population growth rate and invasion success, although rapidly reproducing species could have an advantage when the new environment resembled their native environment. Furthermore, in many cases, those species that could prioritize survival, and delay reproduction, were much more successful than those forced to reproduce regardless of environmental conditions.</p>
