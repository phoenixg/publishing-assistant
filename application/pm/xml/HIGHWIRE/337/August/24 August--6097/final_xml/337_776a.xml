<p>Introducing evidence of a biological basis of dysfunctional behavior might induce a judge to impose a lighter sentence upon defendants on the grounds that their innate biology lessened personal responsibility for their actions. On the other hand, it might also plausibly lead to a longer sentence on the grounds that this biological predisposition would imply a higher risk of future criminal acts. <bold>Aspinwall <italic>et al.</italic></bold> (p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="846">846</related-article>) analyzed sentencing opinions from a nationwide group of judges in the United States of a scenario closely modeled on a real-life case. Varying two factors&#x2014;whether evidence for a biological basis was presented and whether it was offered by the defense or by the prosecution&#x2014;revealed an overall lessening of sentences when biology was invoked.</p>
