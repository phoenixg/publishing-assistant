<p>Human-induced global warming is increasing the chances that Texas will be hit with record heat and dryness or that the United Kingdom will have an unusually mild winter&#x2014;but linking extreme weather to global warming isn&apos;t always that simple, note a group of analyses in the July issue of the <italic>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society</italic>. For example, the strengthening greenhouse had nothing to do with last year&apos;s flooding in Thailand, the new analyses find.</p>

<p>Researchers under the aegis of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.K. Met Office used a variety of techniques to search for any link between the atmosphere&apos;s mounting greenhouse gases and extreme weather and climate around the world. Some methods involved climate modeling, while others drew on long climate records for the regions involved.</p>
<p>The backers of this first prompt analysis of extreme climate and weather events plan to make it an annual &#x201C;attribution service&#x201D; to sort out global warming&apos;s effects on high-profile events while they are still fresh in the minds of the public and decision makers. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scim.ag/2011extremes"><bold>http://scim.ag/2011extremes</bold></ext-link></p>
