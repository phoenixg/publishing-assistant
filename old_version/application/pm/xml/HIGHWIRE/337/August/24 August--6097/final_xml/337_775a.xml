<p>A wide range of animals can adapt their color patterns as a means of camouflage or otherwise changing their appearance. This is accomplished through changes in coloration, contrast, patterning, or shape. <bold>Morin <italic>et al.</italic></bold> (p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="828">828</related-article>) show at a basic level that some of these features can be added as microfluidic layers attached to mobile, flexible, soft machines. By pumping different fluids through the channels, the robots were able to change their coloration or overall contrast and could thus blend into the background of the surface they were lying upon. Conversely, by pumping through fluids of different temperature, the infrared profile of the robot could be changed without changing its visible coloration.</p>
