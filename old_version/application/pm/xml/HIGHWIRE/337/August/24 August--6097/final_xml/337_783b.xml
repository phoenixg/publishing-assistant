<p>Physicist and radio astronomer <bold>Bernard Lovell</bold>, who was the founder and first director of the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, U.K., died on 6 August. He was 98.</p>
<p>Lovell headed the observatory from 1957 to 1981. He conceived the idea for the observatory&apos;s 76-meter-diameter Lovell telescope in 1945; it became the world&apos;s largest telescope upon its completion in 1957, and it was also the only telescope in the West able to track the Soviet Union&apos;s Sputnik 1 satellite.</p>
<p>Under Lovell, teams at the observatory made important discoveries: The telescope was the first to spy quasars, and Jodrell Bank scientists have discovered almost two-thirds of the known pulsars.</p>
