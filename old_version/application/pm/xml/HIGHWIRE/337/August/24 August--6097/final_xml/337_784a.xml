<p>As the amount of digital information grows at an ever faster pace, the race is on to find new storage media. A paper published online 16 August in <italic>Science</italic> offers one surprising entrant: DNA.</p>
<p>Less than a gram of DNA can store hundreds of petabytes (millions of gigabytes) of information. But you need a practical system for reading and writing. So a team led by George Church of Harvard Medical School in Boston created a code for converting a digital file into short DNA fragments. Each fragment carries a &#x201C;barcode&#x201D; address that records its location in the original file, and a chunk of digital data, coded as a string of zeroes (A or C in the DNA alphabet) and ones (G or T).</p>
<p>To test the code, the team converted a genetics book co-written by Church into DNA fragments, and then printed them onto a DNA chip. After resequencing the DNA fragments from the chip and converting them back into the book, the error rate was only about 2 bits per million&#x2014;comparable to a typical DVD disk, but far smaller. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scim.ag/DNAcodes"><bold>http://scim.ag/DNAcodes</bold></ext-link></p>
