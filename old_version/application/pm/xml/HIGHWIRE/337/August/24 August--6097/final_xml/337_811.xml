<p>A quarter century after their initial discovery, copper oxide high-temperature superconductors (HTSs) continue to fascinate and frustrate researchers. One of the big challenges to understanding these materials is that the standard model of electron motion in solids&#x2014;the same model that had to be developed before Bardeen, Cooper, and Schrieffer could formulate their theory of superconductivity in 1957&#x2014;does not apply, and no convenient replacement is yet in sight. While theoretical efforts proceed, the focus of research has periodically shifted from one experimental surprise to another. For example, several years ago it was discovered in the superconducting compound YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+<italic>x</italic></sub> that when the superconducting order is suppressed by a very strong magnetic field, various electronic responses oscillate with the field strength in a way that indicates the presence of a new electronic ordering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). These experiments stimulated a great deal of theoretical excitement, but a compelling explanation has been lacking. On page <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="821" issue="6096">821</related-article> of this issue, Ghiringhelli <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>) report the experimental observation of a specific charge ordering more complicated than generally imagined. Together with an independent study of this order in a magnetic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>), an explanation for the quantum oscillation experiments appears to be at hand. At the same time, these results yield new puzzles.</p>
<p>Although the driving motivation is to determine the microscopic explanation of high-temperature superconductivity, a big challenge is to understand the high-temperature metallic phase (above the superconducting transition temperature, <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub>) from which the superconductivity develops (see the figure). The electrons in a solid interact with each other via Coulomb and exchange interactions, creating a complicated electronic liquid; nevertheless, in the standard model of solid-state theory, Fermi liquid theory, one transforms from electrons to an effective set of independent quasiparticles.</p>
<p>Fermi liquid theory is extremely effective for calculating the properties of many metallic materials; unfortunately, it fails when applied to the cuprates. To understand why, we turn to the HTS parent materials, such as YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, which contain CuO<sub>2</sub> planes. Normally, the conduction electrons would lower their energy by spreading throughout the planes, but here the Coulomb repulsion between electrons is strong enough to localize them, making the material an electrical insulator. A consequence of the localization is antiferromagnetism, whereby single electrons in half-filled Cu 3d orbitals on neighboring sites align their spins in opposite directions. In the case of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+<italic>x</italic></sub>, the density of charge carriers is adjusted by adding oxygen atoms (by an amount <italic>x</italic>) to the Cu-O chain layers. Above a threshold level of added oxygen, the material becomes metallic; however, the antiferromagnetic spin correlations survive dynamically. Furthermore, the measured density of charge carriers reflects only those induced by the added oxygen; the initially localized conduction electrons do not appear to delocalize in response to the chemical modification. Although there are many theoretical proposals to describe this unusual &#x201C;normal&#x201D; state, no new simplifying paradigm has yet appeared.</p>

<p>The normal state is usually studied at temperatures above the superconducting transition, but one can also cool into the superconducting state and destroy the superconducting order by applying a strong magnetic field. It came as a shock when such measurements on YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+<italic>x</italic></sub> first revealed evidence of quantum oscillations in electronic responses, because the observed behavior appears to be well described on the basis of Fermi liquid theory. There is a catch, though; application of the standard model to the results implies that the magnetic field causes a radical change in the electronic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Many models of the electronic ordering have been proposed, especially models of spin or charge stripe order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>), in which antiferromagnetic correlations and charge density modulations form an interlocked pattern. Similar electronic properties have been demonstrated in YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+<italic>x</italic></sub> at high magnetic field and in cuprates that exhibit stripe order at zero magnetic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments indicate the onset of charge ordering in YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+<bold><italic>x</italic></bold></sub> in a magnetic field of 15 T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>If there is periodic charge order, one would expect to see it by diffraction. Ghiringhelli <italic>et al.</italic> provide the first such evidence. To enhance the sensitivity, they performed soft x-ray scattering at photon energies resonant with Cu 3d levels on a spectrometer capable of resolving inelastic signals. The big surprise is that the modulation is in two directions, not just one as for stripes. At lower temperatures, the charge modulations are correlated over 16 lattice spacings, suggesting that they are almost ordered&#x2014;but the lack of splitting of the NMR signal in a small magnetic field suggests that the charge modulations may be dynamic. The signal shows up at temperatures at least twice <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub>, but only for the limited range of carrier densities at which quantum oscillations have been observed.</p>
<p>Independent work with very hard x-rays, and measuring in magnetic fields of up to 17 T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>), confirm the two modulation wave vectors, providing further details on the correlations and showing that below <italic>T</italic><sub>c</sub>, the applied field enhances the intensity of the scattering peaks (with the correlation length reaching 25 lattice spacings). Thus, it appears that the competing order responsible for the quantum oscillations has been detected, and details will likely soon be sorted out.</p>
<p>But this answer to the quantum oscillation problem leads to new questions. Although there has been a proposal regarding fluctuating charge modulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>), many theorists believe that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations play an important role in the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>); however, the present charge modulations have no obvious connection with the observed spin modulations, especially the uniaxial spin modulations reported at lower doping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Have Ghiringhelli <italic>et al.</italic> detected a type of charge modulation that is universal among cuprates? Or does it depend on unique features of the YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>6+<italic>x</italic></sub> structure? Do the indications of &#x201C;conventional&#x201D; electronic behavior revealed by the quantum oscillation experiments point to a hidden simplicity? Or do we still have to struggle with the challenging problem of strongly correlated electron physics? Whatever the answers, the work by Ghiringhelli <italic>et al.</italic> will surely stimulate more investigations in a fascinating field.</p>
