<p>A contraceptive pill for men has stumped researchers for decades. But new research published in <italic>Cell</italic> this week suggests there may be hope. A small molecule given to male mice renders them infertile without affecting the animals&apos; testosterone or other hormone levels. And the effect is reversible: When the researchers stopped giving the animals the compound, their sperm production came back and they were able to sire healthy offspring after 1 or 2 months.</p>
<p>The compound, called JQ1, blocks the function of a protein called BRDT, which is crucial for sperm development. It was originally developed as an anticancer agent, targeting a protein related to BRDT called BRD4. Although the mice in the study seemed to have no obvious side effects while on the treatment, study authors Martin Matzuk of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and James Bradner of Harvard Medical School in Boston say that a more specific compound, which targets only the testis-specific BRDT, is needed before testing in healthy men. That should be possible, they say; colleagues at the University of Oxford have identified the detailed crystal structures of BRDT interacting with JQ1, which provides helpful clues. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scim.ag/manpill"><bold>http://scim.ag/manpill</bold></ext-link></p>
