<p>An ambitious new scorecard aims to give the broadest view yet of the condition of the world&apos;s oceans and their ability to provide benefits to humans. Overall, the oceans score 60 out of a possible 100 points, which the authors describe in this week&apos;s issue of <italic>Nature</italic> as &#x201C;a cautionary message.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Rather than focusing on only marine life conservation, the new index also considers human uses of the oceans, such as artisanal fishing, tourism, and other coastal livelihoods. &#x201C;The index shifts our focus to what people want from oceans and how we achieve that in a sustainable way,&#x201D; says lead author Benjamin Halpern of the University of California, Santa Barbara. The team gathered global data from about 171 countries and territories, set performance targets, and scored the countries for current conditions and trends. Scores ranged from 36 (Sierra Leone) to 86 (uninhabited Jarvis Island); only 5% of locations scored higher than 70. The holistic index is &#x201C;a breakthrough on a number of counts,&#x201D; says Margaret Caldwell of Stanford University, who was not involved. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2012/08/the-health-of-the-oceans-in-a-si.html"><bold>http://scim.ag/oceanindex</bold></ext-link></p>
