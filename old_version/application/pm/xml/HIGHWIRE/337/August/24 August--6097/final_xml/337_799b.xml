<body>
<p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently prepared a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to experimentally study the removal of northern barred owls (<italic>Strix varia varia</italic>) as part of the recovery effort for the threatened northern spotted owl (<italic>Strix occidentalis caurina</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). The ethical, economic, and opportunity costs associated with the proposed research raise crucial questions about endangered species research. Previous research on interspecies competition, including spotted owl and barred owl interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>), has already clearly shown that spotted owls would benefit from the removal of their competitor. As proposed, the new study will merely confirm those results, while failing to address the fundamental problem: how to implement management at a scale that benefits spotted owls.</p>
<p>It is impossible to design appropriate experiments without first identifying feasible management options. The EIS fails to identify how study results would guide management [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>), pp. 5&#x2013;6]. Removal of barred owls at a scale that will be effective for long-term conservation is not realistic because of the expected high immigration rates of barred owls into removal areas. Conducting the proposed removal experiment before designating feasible management approaches will waste funds that could be used for implementing adaptive management. This might include removal of barred owls to create short-term refugia. Adaptive management could take advantage of the high variation in niche overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>) to promote coexistence. Regardless of the approaches taken, conducting the removal experiments will distract researchers, management agencies, and others from identifying and taking feasible management actions in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Going ahead with the removal experiments would likely result in a loss of public trust. The killing of barred owls for research that is unlikely to be informative, the high financial cost to the public, and the opportunity costs associated with postponing adaptive management have little justification. Public support for wildlife research and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in particular may be severely eroded.</p>
