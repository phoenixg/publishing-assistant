<p>One hundred and fifty years ago, the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates first developed the theory of mimicry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Based on his field observations in the Amazon, he argued that the uncanny likeness of unrelated butterflies is an evolutionary adaptation whereby edible butterflies avoid predation by imitating the coloration of venomous butterfly species without paying the cost of arming themselves. Such &#x201C;Batesian mimicry&#x201D; is a dynamic parasitic game between three players, in which a harmless species (the mimic) escapes predation by imitating the warning signals of harmful species (the model) that a shared predator (the dupe) has learned to avoid. On page <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="578" issue="6094">578</related-article> of this issue, Thorogood and Davies show that Batesian mimicry dynamics also apply to the evolutionary game between cuckoos and their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>The key selective mechanism in the Batesian mimicry game is the predator's ability to learn, generalize, and remember (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). The predator learns by trial and error to avoid the harmful species and to generalize the bad experience of the model as prey to the mimic. If mimics appear in high numbers, the predator's good experience with the mimic as prey may decrease the survival of mimics and models, because both will be seen as harmless. This mechanism results in greater protection for rare mimics than for common ones. Because of this &#x201C;negative frequency-dependent selection&#x201D; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>), mimics are usually less numerous than models. To increase their population size, imitators have two options. They can imitate a model that is so dangerous that dupes do not dare to touch the imitators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>), or they can evolve multiple forms (polymorphism), enabling them to mimic several different models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>).</p>

<title>The advantages of mimicry.</title>
<p>Thorogood and Davies show that cuckoos that mimic sparrow hawks increase their chance to approach the warbler's nest and lay their eggs (<bold>A</bold>). The deception can break down when the warblers learn to discriminate between gray cuckoos and sparrow hawks and spread this information to others (<bold>B</bold>). This gives an advantage to the rufous cuckoos, which should become more numerous as a result. However, when neighbors warn about rufous cuckoos, the gray morph gets an advantage (<bold>C</bold>).</p>

<p>Cuckoos (Cuculidae) are nest parasites that infiltrate a nest, remove one of the eggs, and replace it with their own egg. Nest parasitism enables cuckoos to have their young raised by host birds and frees them from the costs of parenting. As hosts have evolved to defend their nests from cuckoos, so cuckoos have evolved counteradaptations to overcome the hosts' defense. One trick that allows common cuckoos (<italic>Cuculus canorus</italic>) to approach the nest of their host is by mimicking a sparrow hawk (<italic>Accipiter nisus</italic>), one of the most dangerous predators for the host birds. Cuckoos that resemble hawks are not mobbed by their hosts and can thus more easily approach the nest to lay their eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>But why do European common cuckoos have polymorphic plumage? Males are always gray, but females can be either gray, like the male, or rufous (brown) (see the figure). This could suggest that some females are imitating other avian predators such as kestrels or merlins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Plumage polymorphism is very common in other cuckoo species too, and all polymorphic cuckoo species are brood parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11"><italic>11</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Is plumage polymorphism widespread in this group because cuckoos evolved to resemble several different models due to negative frequency-dependent selection? This remains to be tested, but as we learn from the experiment by Thorogood and Davies, polymorphism among mimics can be maintained with a mechanism that is novel to mimicry literature.</p>
<p>Like many animals, birds can observe and learn from other birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Reed warblers, the most important host species for cuckoos in the UK, learn from their neighbors how to defend their nests against cuckoos. Individuals that have observed how their neighbors have mobbed a cuckoo are braver to approach, mob, and defend their nests against the parasite, thereby enhancing their reproductive success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Thorogood and Davies now show that a reed warbler that has seen its neighbor mob a gray cuckoo will increase its mobbing against gray cuckoos but not against brown cuckoos, and vice versa. If this social information about cuckoo presence in the area spreads too widely, the more common morph can lose its mimetic advantage. This gives the rarer type a chance to lay its eggs in warbler's nests because the hosts do not recognize it.</p>
<p>The details of this hawk-cuckoo-warbler game are different to Batesian mimicry, but they share a core principle. In systems where appearance is used as deception, negative frequency-dependent selection favors polymorphism in the cheating party. In contrast to classical Batesian mimicry, the hawk (model) does not benefit from the discriminative learning of the dupe, and it is unlikely that the mimicry of the cuckoo harms the hawks. It remains to be shown whether the information sharing among dupes reported in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>) could also be applied to the evolution of Batesian mimicry. Thus far, the evidence suggests that predators are more likely to pick up social information on what to eat rather than what to avoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Thorogood and Davies's findings show that, 150 years after its discovery, mimicry still contributes fundamental insights into ecological and evolutionary biology. It remains unclear why rufous cuckoos are not increasing in numbers in the UK, despite their rarity advantage. Perhaps the rufous cuckoo is not as good a predator imitator as the gray cuckoo, and thus cannot fool the hosts as well. Or perhaps the rufous females have some physiological or reproductive disadvantages compared to the gray females. The answer may lie in locations, like Hungary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15"><italic>15</italic></xref>), where rufous cuckoos are more numerous than in the UK.</p>
<p>Another fascinating question is why individual reed warblers vary so much in their responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>) and risk-taking toward the hawk and the parasite. And how many individuals must learn to discriminate between the cuckoo and the hawk and share this information with others to maintain the plumage polymorphism in the cuckoo?</p>
