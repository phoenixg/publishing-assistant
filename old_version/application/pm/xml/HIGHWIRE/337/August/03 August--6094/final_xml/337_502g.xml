<p>Species that are parasitized by cuckoos have evolved several strategies for trying to avoid having their nests hijacked&#x2014;one of the most obvious being outright attacking, or mobbing, of cuckoos that enter the area. However, cuckoos are not without evolved defenses&#x2014;most common cuckoo females look remarkably similar to a small hawk, and this mimicry deters mobbing. <bold>Thorogood and Davies</bold> (p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="578">578</related-article>; see the Perspective by <bold><related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="532" issue="6094">Mappes and Lindstr&#x00F6;m</related-article></bold>) show that social learning in parasitized birds can thwart this protective mimicry. When hosts observe mimics being mobbed, they are more likely to mob them, themselves, later. However, the hosts will only mob the color morph that they observed being mobbed. This specificity may have allowed for the evolution and maintenance of two female morphs within common cuckoos.</p>
