<p>We agree with Amon that the scientific endeavour cannot be complicit in tacitly accepting or blithely ignoring human rights abuses in the name of research. In that vein, we can assure readers that we saw no indication of the abuses Amon describes in the Beijing Ankang Hospital or Tian-Tang-He Drug Rehabilitation Center, where we carried out the study. We interviewed all of the study participants in private, and we did not share their decision to participate or not with the staff in the treatment centers. This was done to prevent the decision from affecting their ongoing treatment. Furthermore, our confidential interviews with the study participants did not reveal any examples of abuses they encountered, and this is consistent with the observations of our research team. The human rights violations mentioned by Amon would have violated China's new National Narcotics Control Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>) and Chinese law in general.</p>
<p>Our research was funded by the Chinese Natural Science Foundation. In 2010, before starting recruitment for the study, we received approval from the Human Investigation Committee of the Peking University Health Center. The review committee knew at the time of approval that participants were in court-mandated treatment and that all requirements for their inclusion in a research study were met. According to the regulation of the Human Investigation Committee, we had provided all details of our proposed recruitment process and our plans to compensate participants for their time.</p>
<p>For our study, we interviewed more than 200 patients who were in court-mandated treatment and only enrolled those who had an interest in participating and who signed the consent form. We explicitly told all participants that they had the right to withdraw their consent and quit the study at any time. As part of the study, we offered participants the opportunity to engage in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), an evidence-based treatment aimed at helping them avoid environmental-cue&#x2013;induced drug craving and relapse in the future. Withdrawing from the study did not affect participants' eligibility to receive the usual treatments typically provided in Beijing treatment centres. All of this was consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Treatment centers in Beijing provide comprehensive care, including detoxification with methadone, relief from physical symptoms with various medications, psychological counseling, and regular medical treatment of conditions such as chronic pain, hypertension, diabetes, insomnia, and anxiety. All these services are provided for free. Patients with severe medical problems are transferred to specialized facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). In some centers in China, addicted individuals voluntarily receive training in sports, art, and working skills, not for punitive reasons, but to equip them with coping skills and alternatives to drug abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Patients who work are always paid. This provision has been put into effect for many years, and recently has been written in the National Narcotics Control Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>), which bans forced labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). After one year of treatment, each patient is evaluated by professional committees; if the patient is doing well behaviorally and medically, he or she will return to the community. The Chinese National Narcotic Law requires that the total duration of court-mandated rehabilitation treatment for drug addicts cannot be more than 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). According to the Annual Report on Drug Control in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>), by the end of 2010, more than 200,000 former drug addicts had completed courtmandated treatment and are now free citizens in the community.</p>
