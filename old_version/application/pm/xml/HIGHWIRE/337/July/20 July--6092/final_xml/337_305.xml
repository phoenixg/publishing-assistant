<p>Sulfur takes part in many biogeochemical reactions that affect the global carbon and oxygen cycles. On short time scales and in the absence of oxygen, many microbes use organic carbon to reduce sulfate to sulfide, which may then react with iron to form pyrite. On much longer time scales, the net addition of oxygen to the atmosphere through organic carbon burial promotes sulfide oxidation on land and increases the amount of sulfate carried by rivers to the oceans. Two reports in this issue, by Wortmann and Paytan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>) on page <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="334" issue="6092">334</related-article> and Halevy <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>) on page <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="337" page="331" issue="6092">331</related-article>, show that on time scales of millions of years, changes in the formation and dissolution of evaporite minerals can strongly impact marine chemistry and the carbon cycle (see the figure). On longer time scales, the sulfur cycle played a much greater role in regulating atmospheric oxygen levels than previously recognized.</p>
<p>Earth scientists have long appreciated that marine sulfate concentrations have changed substantially through time as a result of varying sulfur fluxes to and from the ocean. The story has generally been framed in terms of changing inputs. The sulfate content of the ocean should track the oxidation history of the Earth's surface. As oxygen levels increase, so, too, should sulfide oxidation on land and the resulting flux of sulfate via rivers to the ocean. Because oxygen levels at the Earth's surface are thought to have been relatively stable since &#x223C;580 million years ago, marine sulfate concentrations would be expected to have been largely unchanged through the Phanerozoic (since &#x223C;542 million years ago).</p>

<title>Reassessing marine sulfur fluxes.</title>
<p>The main sulfur inputs to the ocean are the dissolution of evaporite minerals and oxidative weathering of pyrite; the main sulfur outputs are the formation and burial of evaporites and pyrite. During the Phanerozoic, pyrite deposition and weathering have dominated these fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). However, episodic, massive changes in evaporite formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>) and dissolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>) strongly impact the marine sulfur cycle on million-year time scales.</p>

<p>However, over the past decade, scientists have found that Phanerozoic sulfate concentrations varied considerably (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). Sulfate concentrations in the modern ocean are 28 mM, but the composition of fluid inclusions in halite suggests that Phanerozoic levels may have fluctuated between &#x223C;5 and 25 mM. The time resolution of these data is quite low, but this work suggests that the flux of sulfur into and out of the ocean has fluctuated much more than previously recognized.</p>
<p>To better constrain sulfur fluxes to and from the ocean, Wortmann and Paytan use a model that tracks the mass and sulfur isotope composition of fluxes into and out of the ocean. Most sulfur in the ocean is brought there by rivers as a result of oxidative weathering of sulfides and dissolution of calcium sulfates. Sulfur is removed from the ocean through microbial sulfate reduction followed by pyrite burial, and by calcium sulfate (evaporite) deposition. Evaporite deposition does not have a large effect on the sulfur isotopic composition, but microbial sulfate reduction does, because microbes prefer to use <sup>32</sup>S over <sup>34</sup>S during the production of sulfide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>). As a result, the sulfur isotope composition (&#x03B4;<sup>34</sup>S<sub>sulfate</sub>) of river inputs today is &#x223C;6 per mil (&#x2030;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>), but that of seawater sulfate is &#x223C;20&#x2030;.</p>
<p>Variations in &#x03B4;<sup>34</sup>S<sub>sulfate</sub> are traditionally interpreted to reflect changes in the total amount of sulfur buried in ocean sediments as pyrite&#x2014;a parameter referred to as <italic>f</italic><sub>pyr</sub>.</p>
<p>Wortmann and Paytan conclude that a 5&#x2030; negative &#x03B4;<sup>34</sup>S<sub>sulfate</sub> shift in &#x223C;120-million-year-old rocks was caused by massive seawater sulfate removal that accompanied large-scale evaporite deposition during the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. Evaporite formation does not cause sulfur isotope fractionation; in the model, the negative &#x03B4;<sup>34</sup>S<sub>sulfate</sub> shift is driven by lower pyrite burial rates resulting from substantially reduced marine sulfate levels. The authors attribute a 5&#x2030; positive &#x03B4;<sup>34</sup>S<sub>sulfate</sub> shift about 50 million years ago to an abrupt increase in marine sulfate concentrations as a result of large-scale dissolution of freshly exposed evaporites; they argue that the higher sulfate concentrations led to more pyrite burial.</p>
<p>Halevy <italic>et al.</italic> likewise study past sulfur fluxes to and from the ocean, but over longer time scales (the past 500 million years). They quantify sulfate evaporite burial rates through time with the help of a database that contains surface and subsurface information on sedimentary strata from locations across North America and the Caribbean. They then scale these rates to obtain a global estimate.</p>
<p>The results indicate that sulfate burial rates were higher than previously estimated, but also greatly variable. When Halevy <italic>et al.</italic> integrated these improved evaporite burial fluxes with seawater sulfate concentration estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>) and sulfur isotope constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>), their calculations implied that Phanerozoic <italic>f</italic><sub>pyr</sub> values were &#x223C;100% higher on average than previously recognized. These surprisingly high and constant pyrite burial outputs must have been balanced by equally high and constant inputs of sulfate to the ocean via sulfide oxidation (weathering).</p>
<p>The relatively high and constant rates of pyrite weathering and burial over long geologic time scales, identified by Halevy <italic>et al.</italic>, suggest that the consumption and production of oxygen via these processes played a larger role in regulating Phanerozoic atmospheric oxygen levels than previously recognized&#x2014;perhaps by as much as 50%. However, both studies recognize the importance of episodic evaporite burial on the sulfur cycle, and Wortmann and Paytan show that large-scale deposition and dissolution of these evaporites over relatively short geologic time scales can have an enormous impact on marine sulfate concentrations, pyrite burial rates, and the carbon cycle.</p>
<p>The studies by Wortmann and Paytan and Halevy <italic>et al.</italic> highlight the dynamic nature of the Phanerozoic sulfur cycle and its importance in regulating the chemistry of the ocean-atmosphere system. Future work should focus on better constraining marine sulfate levels and global sulfate burial rates through time, the relationship between marine sulfate concentrations and pyrite burial rates, and the role of sulfur in regulating ocean nutrient cycling, the carbon cycle, and ultimately climate.</p>
