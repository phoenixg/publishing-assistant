<p>Nitrogen occurs naturally as a rather tightly bound neutral dimer, and anionic azide (N<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>) salts have long been accessible as well. A cation composed purely of nitrogen arrived only much more recently on the scene, with the preparation of an N<sub>5</sub><sup>+</sup> salt about a decade ago. The heavier congener phosphorus has followed a similar path: a variety of well-established neutral and negatively charged morphologies, but until now no tractable cation salts. K&#x00F6;chner <italic>et al.</italic> have filled the gap with the preparation of a P<sub>9</sub><sup>+</sup> salt. Key to its isolation was the use of an especially inert, aluminum-centered counterion adorned with trifluoromethyl groups. The synthesis entailed oxidation of neutral P<sub>4</sub> by the nitrosonium salt of this counterion in dichloromethane solvent. Ultraviolet irradiation facilitated reaction of an apparent [P<sub>4</sub>NO]<sup>+</sup> intermediate (and precipitation of excess neutral phosphorus) without damaging the ultimate product, which was isolable as a yellow-orange powder. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in conjunction with theoretical calculations revealed a figure 8-type structure, of <italic>D</italic><sub>2<italic>d</italic></sub> symmetry, in which a central tetracoordinate P atom bridges two clusters of four P atoms each. The salt was also characterized by mass spectrometry and infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and persisted for weeks in room-temperature solution. The authors envision prospective applications of the salt in currentless deposition protocols.</p>
