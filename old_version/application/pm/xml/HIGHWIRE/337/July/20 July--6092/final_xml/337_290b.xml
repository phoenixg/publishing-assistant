<p>I am writing in reaction to the cover photo and accompanying caption selected for the 18 May <related-article related-article-type="in-this-publication" vol="336" page="818" issue="6083">special issue</related-article> on Human Conflict. It seems disingenuous to claim that of all the world's conflicts, a building identified as destroyed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was &#x201C;not [chosen] for any political message or endorsement.&#x201D; Nobody eschews war more than Israelis, who, unfortunately, also know the consequences.</p>

<p>If the editors wanted striking visual impact and gruesome evidence of inhumanity, there were better choices: the killing fields of Cambodia, the destruction of the World Trade Center, Rwanda, Dresden, Hiroshima, Bataan, Darfur, Armenia, Normandy, Auschwitz&#x2026; unfortunately, the list of greater carnage is nearly endless.</p>
<p>By identifying the IDF as perpetrators, the caption undermined the photo's role as a generic illustration of the consequences of conflict. Indeed, there was no need to identify the details. They were a distraction. The photo no longer represented abstract human violence, but rather one more illustration of Israel, taken out of context. Portraying Israel as the aggressor obscures the fact that the country is trying to defend itself against decades of assaults provoked by ethnic hostility&#x2014;attacks still taking place. That is politicized science, which serves to encourage&#x2014;not discourage&#x2014;conflict.</p>
