<p>Five years ago, the Phoenix lander found perchlorate salts in one spot in the martian arctic. Now, Curiosity rover has discovered perchlorates in equatorial Gale crater as well, implying that they carpet the martian surface. The discovery explains why the rover stumbled in its first search for organic traces of ancient martian life. Indeed, perchlorates, it seems, have been frustrating three generations of organic analyses on Mars.</p>
<p>Curiosity's discovery of perchlorate salts&#x2014;compounds consisting of a chlorine atom, four oxygens, and an element like magnesium&#x2014;came when it ran its first solid sample through its Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package. The rover scooped windblown dust into SAM and gradually heated it up to 835&#x00B0;C. It continuously flushed the resulting gases&#x2014;which researchers hoped might include volatile organic matter&#x2014;through a mass spectrometer for identification.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Paul Archer of NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and fellow Curiosity team members reported that as the sample temperature passed through about 400&#x00B0;C, SAM identified both molecular oxygen and a variety of chlorine-containing, single-carbon compounds. Together, those molecules made "a strong case for perchlorates" in the sample, Archer said.</p>
<p>That's because perchlorate salts in martian soil would have decomposed to chlorine and oxygen at that sort of temperature, and the chlorine would have combined with any nearby carbon to form the observed single-carbon compounds. Meanwhile, the oxygen would have burned any other carbon compounds present to carbon dioxide, which also came out then. The coincident release of oxygen and chlorinated compounds plus the previous detection of chlorine in every martian soil ever tested "lead to the conclusion that perchlorates are globally distributed on Mars," at least in the soil, the group said in its meeting abstract.</p>
<p>Pervasive perchlorates would explain a lot. Their presence on Mars wasn't so surprising once geochemists thought about i t: The ultraviolet of sunlight could produce them by zapping other compounds in the atmosphere or directly in the soil, where the aridity of Mars would preserve them, as the aridity of Earth's Atacama Desert does. Heating them together with any sort of carbon-containing compounds&#x2014;once-living or not&#x2014;in martian soil would yield Curiosity's result, which closely matches what the two Viking landers saw in their own heated-sample experiments in the late 1970s. The less sensitive Phoenix lander experiment detected only carbon dioxide in its heating experiments.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Experiments to date on Mars may or may not have detected martian organic matter. And because hot perchlorates react with any kind of carbon, it's unlikely that the question can be settled with heating experiments alone. But Curiosity isn't finished. In a first on Mars, SAM can isolate certain types of organic compounds at low temperatures before sending them on to the mass spectrometer. The catch is that SAM can run this "wet chemistry" analysis only seven times in the entire mission. Choose wisely, Curiosity.</p>
