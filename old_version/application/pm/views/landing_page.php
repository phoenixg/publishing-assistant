 <p>This application is designed to assist with routine publishing tasks on the <em>Science</em> web platform. It presents a simple interface for inserting data into page templates, meaning that you can create files without needing to understand XML or HTML. It also offers a number of error checking and labor saving features.</p>
	
					<h3>The Basic Process</h3>
	
					
					<p><img src="<?php echo base_url(); ?>img/overview-diagram.jpg" alt="Flow diagram showing the workflow of this tool."></p>
	
					<p>To begin, choose a template group from the list on the left. On the following page you will see data for the upcoming issue, such as the publish date, volume and issue numbers. The system assumes that you require the next calendar issue, relative to today's date, but you can edit the default values if neccessary. Beneath that, you select which specific templates you wish to process. As you select templates you will notice additional fields appearing lower on the page. You may also edit the output file name and location if you wish, although in most cases this should not be neccessary.</p>

	
					<p>For each template you selected, the available editable fields are displayed. Enter your data here. The last step is to output the files. This will create new files on network which may be uploaded to HIGHWIRE and published to the live website.</p>
	
					<p>This system is extremely flexible and can be used to help automate any template-based data entry process. All text-format files are supported (html, txt, xml, dtl etc).</p>
