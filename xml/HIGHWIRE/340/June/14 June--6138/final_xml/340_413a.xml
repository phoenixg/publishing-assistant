<title>How Low Can They Go?</title>

<p>The Great Lakes at the U.S.-Canadian border, with Asia's Lake Baikal and Africa's Lake Tanganyika, make up half the volume of the world's surface fresh water supply. This week, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that in January lakes Huron and Michigan dipped to their lowest point since monitoring began in 1860. The record continues almost 15 years of low water that began in 1998, a dry year with unusually warm water, extensive evaporation, and little precipitation and runoff flowing into the lakes. From 1998 through 2000, lake water levels dropped by about a meter, says NOAA hydrologist Andrew Gronewold, who is based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Fish are cut off from the wetlands and rivers they need for reproduction, and giant commercial ships struggle to get through the channels that connect the lakes. NOAA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers predict lake levels will rise this summer, but not by much.</p>
