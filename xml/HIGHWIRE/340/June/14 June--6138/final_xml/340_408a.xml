<p>Humans are adding new reactive forms of nitrogen (N) into the environment, which has the potential to cause a range of problems, including eutrophication and the formation of dead zones in lakes and coastal waters. The microorganisms responsible for these &#x201C;N loss&#x201D; pathways, known as denitrification or anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), often reside in sediments, but a variable and limiting supply of organic matter makes it difficult to determine which reaction dominates. Babbin and Ward set out to address this problem in the lab by constructing a series of mesocosms out of sediments from the Chesapeake Bay, United States, with large amounts of organic matter added to some of the columns. Over 7 weeks of incubation and monitoring, the proportion of each pathway was dictated more by the relative N content of the organic matter than by the total organic matter content. Moreover, the microbial communities in the sediments were able to quickly adjust to high N loading, such as sewage effluent or fertilizer runoff, so that most of the reactive N would be removed from the ecosystem and potentially released back to the atmosphere.</p>
