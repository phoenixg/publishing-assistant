<p>Cultural transmission of information occurs when individuals learn from others with more experience or when individuals come to accept particular modes of behavior as the local norm. Such information transfer can be expected in highly social or long-lived species where contact and time for learning are maximized and are seen in humans (see the Perspective by <bold><related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="340" page="437" issue="6131">de Waal</related-article></bold>). Using a network-based diffusion analysis on a long-term data set that includes tens of thousands of observations of individual humpback whales, <bold>Allen <italic>et al.</italic></bold> (p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="340" issue="6131" page="485">485</related-article>) show that an innovative feeding behavior has spread through social transmission since it first emerged in a single individual in 1980. The &#x201C;lobtail&#x201D; feeding has passed among associating individuals for more than three decades. <bold>Van de Waal <italic>et al.</italic></bold> (p. <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="340" issue="6131" page="483">483</related-article>), on the other hand, used a controlled experimental approach in vervet monkeys to show that individuals learn what to eat from more experienced individuals within their social group. Not only did young animals learn from observing older animals, but immigrating males switched their food preference to that of their new group.</p>
