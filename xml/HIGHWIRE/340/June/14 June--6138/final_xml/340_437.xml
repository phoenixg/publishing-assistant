<p>More than 60 years ago, Kinji Imanishi speculated that if animals can learn from each other, they will inevitably develop different behaviors in different groups, resulting in &#x201C;cultural&#x201D; variation within the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). It was a simple proposal, but so far ahead of its time that few Western scientists paid attention. Only in the past few decades has animal culture taken off as a topic of research. Two reports in this issue give hints of the adaptive value of animal culture. On page <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="340" page="485" issue="6131">485</related-article>, Allen <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>) show that the best explanation for the spreading of a new hunting technique among humpback whales (<italic>Megaptera novaeangliae</italic>) is that they learn from each other, and on page <related-article related-article-type="in-this-issue" vol="340" page="483" issue="6131">483</related-article>, van de Waal <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>) report an innovative field experiment that manipulated the food preferences of wild vervet monkeys (<italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>) to give them an opportunity for social learning.</p>
<p>The early debate about animal culture focused on the mechanism of behavioral transmission. Do animals learn from each other in the same way as humans do? If they copy the behavior of others, does this reflect &#x201C;true&#x201D; imitation, that is, do they understand the other's goals and methods? Apes were said to lack imitative capacities because they failed to imitate human models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). But of course, human models belong to a different species. We now know that apes learn from each other in ways that meet all the requirements of true imitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>).</p>

<p>With that issue behind us, animal culture studies have begun to focus less on the transmission process and more on the strength of animal conformist tendencies and their effect on survival. From the domain of learning, researchers are shifting to that of outcomes and adaptive significance. The reports by Allen <italic>et al.</italic> and van de Waal <italic>et al.</italic> nicely illustrate this new focus.</p>
<p>Allen <italic>et al.</italic> report on an impressive large-scale project, covering 73,790 sightings of individually identified humpback whales in a particular area in the Gulf of Maine over the course of 27 years. Observations were made at the spawning ground of important prey that occurs in large quantities, the sand lance (a 15- to 20-cm fish). The whales used regular bubble feeding, in which they produce air bubbles under the surface to drive the fish together so that they can swallow thousands in a single gulp. However, in 1980, a whale was seen to whack the water surface with his fluke to create a loud noise or disturbance that may have clumped the prey even more. Over the ensuing years, this lobtail technique (see the figure, panel A) became increasingly common in the whale population.</p>
<p>The authors used a network-based diffusion analysis to determine whether being associated with whales that perform the lob-tail technique helped na&#x00EF;ve whales to adopt the same behavior. Independent of how much time the whales spent at the research site, they were more affected by exposure to skilled social partners than by any other potential factor. With a species that is not particularly suitable for controlled experiments, this is as close as we may ever get to proving that habits spread socially. Alternative hypotheses, such as genetic determination of the pattern or individual learning, were unsupported by the analysis.</p>
<p>Because of the neophobia of wild animals, field experiments are hard to conduct. Van de Waal <italic>et al.</italic> succeeded in inducing cultural transmission among wild vervet monkeys using a very elegant, controlled paradigm. They show that groups of wild monkeys can learn to distinguish between differently colored corn furnished by the experimenters. One color was palatable, the other highly distasteful. The two colors were counterbalanced across groups, so that corn of one color was palatable in some groups yet distasteful in others, and vice versa. All groups developed an exclusive preference for the untreated corn.</p>
<p>This by itself is just an example of individual learning, but then the investigators waited for new infants to be born in the groups and for new male immigrants to arrive from neighboring groups. When the researchers gave both groups of monkeys access to palatable corn of both colors, the original residents, showing great conservatism, stuck to their acquired preference (see the figure, panel B). Twenty-six of the 27 newborn infants also ate only the locally preferred food; the one exception was the infant of a female so low in rank that she had been forced to taste the alternative corn in her offspring's presence. The behavior of all infants supported the thesis that food preferences are acquired from mothers and not through individual exploration.</p>
<p>Male immigrants, too, adopted the local color preference, in most cases despite their arrival from groups that had developed the opposite preference. The only exception was an immigrant male who immediately achieved the top rank position in his new group, and who as a result may have been less sensitive to the behavior of the locals.</p>
<p>The two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>) show that cultural learning in animals is not a mere luxury that they occasionally engage in, but a common and widespread mechanism of behavioral acquisition. Conformism among animals&#x2014;that is, the tendency to prefer behavioral options that are common in the local population despite familiarity with or the presence of alternative options&#x2014;has been indicated by experiments on apes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>) and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9"><italic>9</italic></xref>) and documented in behavioral field research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Its confirmation in field experiments suggests that the mechanism is robust, with a great potential to affect survival success.</p>
