<p>How cells recover from a DNA damage&#x2013;induced arrest is currently poorly understood. We performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify changes in protein phosphorylation that occurred during recovery from arrest in the G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle caused by DNA damage.

Astrin, a protein associated with the mitotic spindle, was among the potential regulators of recovery. We found that astrin controlled the abundance of the cell cycle regulator p53 during DNA damage&#x2013;induced arrest. Cells in which astrin was depleted had decreased murine double minute 2 (MDM2) abundance and increased p53 at the later stages of the DNA damage response. Astrin was required for continued expression of genes encoding proteins that promote cell cycle progression in arrested cells. Thus, by controlling p53 abundance in cells recovering from DNA damage, astrin maintains the cells in a state competent to resume the cell cycle.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>When a G<sub>2</sub> cell encounters DNA damage, it activates a checkpoint that prevents entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). This G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint depends on several kinases that initiate and transmit the checkpoint signal to activate DNA repair and arrest the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). To initiate the checkpoint response, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) kinases are recruited to the site of damage where they phosphorylate and activate checkpoint kinases 1 and 2 (CHK1 and CHK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Together, these kinases facilitate a major change in protein phosphorylation that includes inhibitory phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1"><italic>1</italic></xref>). As a consequence, cyclin B&#x2013;CDK1 complexes cannot be activated, causing cells to arrest in G<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Once the DNA damage is repaired, the checkpoint is assumed to be silenced through dephosphorylation or degradation of several key checkpoint components such as ATM or ATR, p53, CHK1, and CHK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3"><italic>3</italic></xref>). This enables the removal of inhibitory phosphates from CDK subunits and promotes reentry into the cell cycle, but the exact mechanism of this reactivation is currently poorly understood. Previous work shows that a number of kinases and phosphatases play a crucial role during recovery in G<sub>2</sub>, namely, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), Aurora A, CDK1, CDK2, and Cdc25B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Aurora A phosphorylates and activates PLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7"><italic>7</italic></xref>), which in turn controls degradation of the kinase WEE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>), which phosphorylates, and thus inhibits, CDK subunits during the DNA damage response. Subsequent removal of the inhibitory phosphates is facilitated by the CDC25B phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Activation of PLK1 not only contributes to reactivation of the cell cycle but also promotes silencing of the DNA damage checkpoint at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8"><italic>8</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13"><italic>13</italic></xref>). This implies that reactivation of the cell cycle is coordinated with silencing of the checkpoint through the action of PLK1.</p>
<p>The DNA damage checkpoint also restricts CDK1 function through the action of p53, which promotes transcriptional activation of the CDK inhibitor p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14"><italic>14</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16"><italic>16</italic></xref>). Moreover, p53 can repress the expression of cyclin B and other mitotic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17"><italic>17</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22"><italic>22</italic></xref>). p53 is required for long-term maintenance of the G<sub>2</sub> arrest, although it is not required to establish a G<sub>2</sub> arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). However, p53-mediated transcriptional repression must be restrained during an ongoing DNA damage response by the wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) to maintain cells in a state from which they can recover from the arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). It is currently not known if and how p53 is inactivated when the checkpoint is switched off.</p>
<p>Several groups have performed large-scale phosphoproteomics on cycling cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24"><italic>24</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25"><italic>25</italic></xref>). Similarly, quantitative phosphoproteomics have been applied to identify new substrates of ATM and ATR that contribute to the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). Here, we have performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis to identify changes in protein phosphorylation that occur during recovery. We identified 154 proteins whose phosphorylation was reproducibly changed during recovery. Systematic depletion of these individual proteins by RNA interference (RNAi) showed that a significant fraction of these proteins were required for recovery from the DNA damage&#x2013;induced arrest.</p>

<title>Comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of checkpoint recovery</title>
<p>Given the importance of kinases and phosphatases in the DNA damage response and the cell cycle machinery, we reasoned that protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation must play an important role in recovery. Therefore, a quantitative phosphorylation-centric shotgun proteomics approach was performed to identify alterations in protein phosphorylation during recovery from doxorubicin in different conditions, depicted schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig. S1A. U2OS osteosarcoma cells were synchronized in G<sub>2</sub> with thymidine and then treated with doxorubicin, an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, to induce double-stranded breaks. Eighteen hours after doxorubicin treatment [a time when all cells are still arrested in G<sub>2</sub> (fig. S1B)], we treated cells with caffeine, an inhibitor of ATM and ATR, to induce mitotic recovery [fig. S1C and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>)]. To obtain a cell population in which the activities of ATM and ATR were inhibited, but recovery was prevented, we treated the arrested cells with caffeine in combination with the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 during the indicated time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig. S1A). Cells treated with caffeine alone will eventually enter mitosis, whereas addition of BI2536 at these time points blocks recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). Mitotic cells were removed by shaking to ensure that our analysis of recovery-associated changes in protein phosphorylation was not contaminated with mitosis-associated changes in protein phosphorylation. This way, the analyzed cell population consisted primarily of late G<sub>2</sub> cells, with few mitotic cells (fig. S1D). Peptides from caffeine-treated or caffeine- and BI2536-treated cells were dimethyl-labeled with light or intermediate isotope, respectively, and mixed in equal ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27"><italic>27</italic></xref>). Phosphopeptides were enriched by strong cation exchange (SCX) chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28"><italic>28</italic></xref>) and titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29"><italic>29</italic></xref>), and fractions were analyzed by liquid chromatography&#x2013;tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (LTQ-Orbitrap MS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30"><italic>30</italic></xref>). Using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1%, we identified and quantified 31,393 unique peptides from the four independent time points. Among these were 6119 unique phosphopeptides, indicative of successful phosphopeptide enrichment. From the 6119 quantified phosphopeptides, 1200 phosphopeptides (from 715 proteins) were altered by at least twofold, indicating that substantial changes in protein phosphorylation occur during recovery from a DNA damage&#x2013;induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1B</xref> and tables S1 to S3). Twenty of these identified proteins (fig. S2A and table S4) interact with the Polo-box domain of PLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31"><italic>31</italic></xref>). Consensus motif analysis done by NetworKIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32"><italic>32</italic></xref>) showed that a large fraction of the differentially phosphorylated peptides contained a CDK consensus motif (fig. S2B), consistent with the reactivation of cyclin and CDK activity that accompanies cell cycle reentry. In addition, the casein kinase consensus motif (CK2A1 and CK2A2) was also abundant (fig. S2B), which is partially due to the rather loose consensus of the motif but is also in line with the observation that casein kinase is essential for tolerance to double-stranded breaks in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Specific analysis of PLK1 consensus motifs showed that there was an almost threefold enrichment in PLK1 sites identified in the phosphopeptides, which were decreased compared with those that were unchanged in the presence of BI2536 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This reduction in the phosphorylation of PLK1 consensus motifs confirmed that BI2536 inhibited PLK1 activity. PLK1 inhibition resulted in the most prominent reduction in phosphorylation of CDK1 consensus motifs at the 6-hour time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>), in agreement with the kinetics of CDK1 activation during recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5"><italic>5</italic></xref>). On the other hand, phosphorylation of PLK1 consensus motifs was mostly enriched at the 2-hour time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1D</xref>). Comparison of independent biological replicates at the same time point (2 hours of treatment) resulted in a relatively high correlation coefficient of 0.77, indicating reproducibility of the proteomic analysis (fig. S2C). Finally, analysis of protein phosphorylation with commercially available antibodies confirmed decreases in phosphorylated CLASP1 at Thr<sup>656</sup>, phosphorylated vimentin at Ser<sup>56</sup>, and phosphorylated STMN1 at Ser<sup>25</sup> in the samples treated with caffeine and BI2536, as compared with the samples treated with caffeine alone (fig. S2D), thus confirming the results from our phosphoproteomics.</p>

<p>Of the 715 proteins that were differentially phosphorylated, 154 were identified at multiple time points (table S5). A significant fraction of the identified proteins have kinase or phosphatase activity, underlining the importance of phospho-regulation in the recovery process (fig. S3, A and B). Most of the candidates function in binding&#x2014;either nucleic acid or protein binding. Moreover, a substantial proportion of the identified proteins are known to act in cell cycle control or DNA repair, suggesting that the repair process might be modified once the cells have committed to cell cycle reentry. In addition, 84 proteins in our list of 715 were previously identified in a phosphoproteomic screen for targets of ATM and ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>), yet they share only two phosphosites (table S6). This indicates that proteins directly modified by DNA damage&#x2013;responsive kinases are additionally modified once these kinases are inactivated.</p>

<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Functional characterization of the recovery-associated phosphoproteome</title>
<p>We next constructed a small interfering RNA (siRNA) library to investigate whether any of the 154 differentially phosphorylated proteins was required for checkpoint recovery. The library, generated from a commercially available genome-wide siRNA library, contained siRNA targeting 147 mRNAs from our list of 154 (siRNAs for seven targets were unavailable in the genome-wide library). The library was plated in pools of four individual siRNA duplexes per target. After protein depletion, cells were analyzed for their ability to recover from a DNA damage&#x2013;induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest. Mitotic index was determined 8 hours after caffeine addition by staining cells with antibodies against phosphorylated histone H3 (pH3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). siRNAs against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or PLK1 were used as negative and positive controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). The screen was performed in triplicate, and proteins whose depletion resulted in greater than 20% reduction in checkpoint recovery in two or more experiments and did not affect mitotic entry in undamaged cultures were selected for further validation. A total of 28 of the 147 proteins fulfilled these criteria and were selected for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref> and table S7). More than two-thirds (20 of 28) displayed altered phosphorylation after 2 and 6 hours of PLK1 inhibition, whereas about one-third was identified as differentially phosphorylated at the 30-min time point in our phosphoproteomic analysis. A minority (11%) of the identified phosphopeptides from these 28 proteins were found to be differentially phosphorylated across all time points.</p>

</caption><graphic xlink:href="6_rs9_F2"></graphic></fig>
<p>To exclude possible off-target effects, we performed siRNA deconvolution for these 28 hits and separately tested the checkpoint recovery effects of the individual siRNAs from each pool used in the primary screen. Using stringent criteria in which at least three of four siRNAs of a pool scored positive (reduced cell cycle recovery by at least 20%) in at least two of three experiments, we validated 10 proteins as regulators of the DNA damage checkpoint recovery. These proteins are directly involved in recovery but not in normal G<sub>2</sub>-M progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref> and table S8). A further 12 proteins on our list showed validation for two of four siRNAs. Thus, our proteomics-directed siRNA screen led to a high hit rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec disp-level="2">
<title>Astrin and G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint recovery</title>
<p>Depletion of astrin (also known as SPAG5) caused the most prominent recovery defect among all of the hits in our screen. Yet, depletion of astrin did not affect normal G<sub>2</sub>-M progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, B and C, and table S7). Astrin is a mitotic spindle&#x2013;associated protein that is important for normal mitotic spindle architecture and chromosome alignment in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34"><italic>34</italic></xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>). Astrin is known to interact with Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37"><italic>37</italic></xref>) and can be phosphorylated in vitro by PLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>). Despite its described functions in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>), nothing is known about a possible function for astrin in G<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>We confirmed that astrin was also required for spontaneous recovery (without the addition of caffeine) after &#x03B3;-irradiation or treatment with doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We observed 50 to 70% fewer mitotic cells in astrin-depleted samples compared to GAPDH-depleted controls. Again, no perturbation of mitotic entry was observed in astrin-depleted cells that were not damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>). We subsequently analyzed which proteins interact with astrin in DNA-damaged cells and identified 11 potential astrin interactors in cultures treated with doxorubicin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3B</xref>), including SKAP, a known partner of astrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>). Depletion of SKAP inhibited recovery after damage-induced arrest to a similar degree as did depletion of astrin and similarly had no effect on unperturbed G<sub>2</sub>-M progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3C</xref>). This further supports a role for astrin in the cellular response to DNA damage and suggests that it may act in complex with SKAP to promote recovery.</p>
<fig id="F3" position="float" fig-type="figure"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption>
<title>Validation of astrin as a novel G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint recovery component.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) U2OS cells were transfected with siRNAs against GAPDH or astrin and subjected to a recovery assay upon 5-Gy &#x03B3;-irradiation or a 1-hour pulse of 1 &#x03BC;M doxorubicin.

</caption><graphic xlink:href="6_rs9_F3"></graphic></fig>
<p>Our phosphoproteomic analysis identified Ser<sup>401</sup> phosphorylation on astrin to be regulated during G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint recovery (table S1). Phosphorylation of astrin at Ser<sup>401</sup> was decreased at both 2 and 4 hours after treatment with the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 (table S5). Consistent with our phosphoproteomics data, we verified phosphorylation of astrin at Ser<sup>401</sup> in damaged cultures treated with caffeine, which was substantially reduced with PLK1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3D</xref>). This concurs with previous reports showing that Ser<sup>401</sup> is phosphorylated in mitotic cells in a PLK1-dependent manner, and that PLK1 can phosphorylate astrin in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>). Thus, we conclude that PLK1 phosphorylates astrin on Ser<sup>401</sup> in vivo.</p>
<p>We next tested the importance of this phosphorylation for G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint recovery. To do this, we established stable U2OS cell lines expressing siRNA-resistant wild-type astrin or an S401A mutant under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter. Endogenous astrin was depleted by siRNA before exogenous astrin expression was induced with tetracycline. Overexpression of siRNA-resistant wild-type astrin partially rescued the recovery defect caused by endogenous astrin depletion. In contrast, the S401A mutant was completely unable to restore recovery in astrin-depleted cells, underlining the importance of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>401</sup> for the function of astrin in recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>

Silencing astrin induces p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Therefore, we wondered if the effect of astrin on recovery was dependent on p53 function. Depletion of astrin did not inhibit recovery from a G<sub>2</sub> arrest when p53 was co-depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>), indicating that the effect of astrin on G<sub>2</sub> recovery is entirely mediated by p53. To confirm this, we next compared the effects of astrin depletion in HCT116 cells and HCT116 p53-null (<italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23"><italic>23</italic></xref>). Similar to our observations in U2OS cells, depletion of astrin from HCT116 cells resulted in inhibition of checkpoint recovery from a G<sub>2</sub> arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, astrin depletion had no effect in HCT116 <italic>p53</italic><sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212;</sup> cells, further supporting a role for p53 as a mediator of this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Furthermore, astrin protein abundance was substantially higher in p53-deficient cells compared with wild-type cells, suggesting that astrin itself may be a target of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>Unattenuated activation of p53 causes cells to lose the ability to resume cell division because of a progressive loss of essential mitotic activators, such as PLK1 and cyclins A and B, as a result of p53-dependent transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4"><italic>4</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Moreover, the oscillatory pattern of p53 abundance after DNA damage is required to maintain the arrest and ensure proper cell cycle reentry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43"><italic>43</italic></xref>). We therefore investigated whether astrin also acts to attenuate p53 activity after activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in G<sub>2</sub> and whether it affects the oscillatory behavior of p53. We observed an increase in p53 abundance after doxorubicin treatment in siGAPDH-transfected cells, with a first peak at 6 to 9 hours after treatment and a second peak 14 to 16 hours afterward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). However, in astrin-depleted cells, the protein abundance of p53 increased to its maximum point as early as 3 hours after doxorubicin treatment and remained high for the duration of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). The increased abundance of p53 in astrin-deficient cells also correlated with a significant increase in the abundance of p21, a cell cycle arrest protein whose gene is transcriptionally activated by p53, and with reduced abundance of cyclin A and PLK1, cell cycle progression proteins whose genes are transcriptionally repressed by p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). These data suggest that depletion of astrin leads to excessive transcriptional repression by p53, resulting in a reduced capacity to recover from the G<sub>2</sub> arrest.</p>

<p>The mRNA abundance of p53 was not affected by astrin depletion, indicating that the regulation of p53 by astrin was most likely at the posttranscriptional level (fig. S4A). The E3 ubiquitin ligase murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is a major regulator of p53 protein abundance, which has been shown to be essential for the dynamic behavior of p53 in response to double-strand DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>). MDM2 is also a transcriptional target of p53, which functions as a part of a feedback loop in response to damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>). In control cells, MDM2 protein abundance was increased in response to DNA damage and reached its maximum abundance at 10 hours after doxorubicin treatment. In contrast, astrin-depleted cells showed a lower basal abundance of MDM2, which did not increase in response to DNA damage, even in the presence of higher abundance of p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). <italic>MDM2</italic> mRNA abundance was similarly induced upon doxorubicin treatment in both control and astrin-depleted cells, with a peak at 8 and 12 hours after treatment, respectively (fig. S4, A and B), suggesting that astrin could regulate MDM2 protein abundance independently of p53. Only at later time points did the amount of <italic>MDM2</italic> mRNA begin to return to endogenous abundance, although this return was much less pronounced in astrin-depleted cells compared with control cells (fig. S4B), probably as a consequence of the high abundance of p53 maintained in the absence of astrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). Therefore, the overall reduction in MDM2 protein abundance together with the increase in p53 protein abundance in astrin-depleted cells suggests that MDM2-dependent proteasomal degradation of p53 is impaired in cells lacking astrin. To confirm that the increase in p53 was indeed due to impaired proteasomal degradation of p53, we treated doxorubicin-treated cultures with the proteasomal inhibitor <italic>N</italic>-carbobenzyloxy-<sc>l</sc>-leucyl-<sc>l</sc>-leucyl-<sc>l</sc>-leucinal (MG132). Whereas MG132 treatment increased p53 abundance in control cells, it failed to further increase it in astrin-depleted cells (fig. S4C). This is consistent with the notion that proteasomal degradation of p53 is impaired in astrin-depleted cells, and indicates that astrin may suppress the protein abundance of p53 by promoting MDM2-dependent degradation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To gain insight into the mechanisms controlling recovery from a DNA damage&#x2013;induced arrest, we performed a phosphoproteomic screen and uncovered more than 700 proteins whose phosphorylation status was altered during recovery, 154 of which showed reproducibly altered phosphorylation at multiple time points. This indicates that substantial changes in protein phosphorylation occur as cells silence the DNA damage checkpoint and reenter the cell cycle. This is in line with the vast changes in protein phosphorylation that occur when the checkpoint is activated; more than 700 proteins are differentially phosphorylated in response to damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>We found substantial enrichment for PLK1 consensus motifs in the peptides that were differentially phosphorylated during recovery, and most of the regulated phosphopeptides contain a CDK consensus, in agreement with our previous observations that PLK1 controls recovery through reactivation of cyclin and CDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>). Many of the proteins phosphorylated or dephosphorylated during recovery are also known ATM and ATR substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26"><italic>26</italic></xref>). However, during recovery, these proteins were phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at sites that are distinct from the known ATM and ATR sites. This suggests that inactivation of these proteins is not only regulated through dephosphorylation but might also involve phosphorylation-dependent inactivation or degradation. This concurs with the current knowledge that PLK1 plays an essential role in both the silencing of the DNA damage checkpoint and the activation of the cell cycle reentry machinery, and that both aspects of recovery are connected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6"><italic>6</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10"><italic>10</italic></xref>).</p>
<p>Depletion of a substantial proportion of the differentially phosphorylated proteins exclusively affected mitotic entry after a DNA damage&#x2013;induced arrest, similar to PLK1, indicating that these proteins actively promote recovery. The fact that such a high percentage of these proteins is involved in recovery indicates that our phosphoproteomic screen successfully identified physiologically relevant proteins. Moreover, the high hit rate shows that the combination of shotgun phosphoproteomics and siRNA-based screens is an excellent approach to uncover new regulators of a given cellular process. Astrin plays important roles in different aspects of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45"><italic>45</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46"><italic>46</italic></xref>), but no clear functions for astrin in interphase have been reported. Through its interaction with the nuclease Apollo (also known as SNM1B), astrin may function in the prophase checkpoint in response to spindle stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47"><italic>47</italic></xref>). Our results clearly demonstrate that astrin is required for mitotic entry after a DNA damage&#x2013;induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest, and that its phosphorylation by PLK1 at Ser<sup>401</sup> is important for this function. Phosphorylation of this residue by PLK1 is also reported in several large screens for PLK1 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36"><italic>36</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38"><italic>38</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40"><italic>40</italic></xref>), both during entry into mitosis and in mitotic arrest, although its functional relevance to the mitotic functions of astrin was not reported. We demonstrate that the small kinetochore-associated protein SKAP, a known mitotic partner of astrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39"><italic>39</italic></xref>), was also required for checkpoint recovery. Together, these findings indicate that astrin and SKAP may function in complex as an effector of PLK1 signaling that, similar to PLK1 itself, plays distinct roles in the cell cycle: (i) regulating mitotic entry after a DNA damage&#x2013;induced arrest in G<sub>2</sub>, and (ii) controlling different aspects of mitosis. We found that astrin promoted G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint recovery through negative regulation of p53. Indeed, astrin is not the only PLK1 substrate that negatively controls p53. PLK1 can directly phosphorylate GTSE1 (G<sub>2</sub> and S phase&#x2013;expressed protein 1), promoting its translocation to the nucleus where it binds p53 and subsequently shuttles p53 out of the nucleus to promote its proteolytic degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48"><italic>48</italic></xref>). Consistent with this, GTSE1 was differentially phosphorylated during recovery (table S1). Negative regulation of p53 involves several additional antagonists, such as MDM2 and WIP1. In this respect, it is important to note that in response to &#x03B3;-irradiation, p53 activation occurs in an oscillatory pattern, controlled by MDM2 and WIP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42"><italic>42</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49"><italic>49</italic></xref>). Thus, during an ongoing DNA damage response, a cell switches between phases of high or low p53 activity. This oscillation may enable continued expression of cell cycle regulatory genes that are essential for the G<sub>2</sub>-M transition, such as cyclin B and PLK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21"><italic>21</italic></xref>). Our results show that the absence of astrin increased the abundance of p53 and perturbed its oscillatory behavior. This correlated with a reduced abundance of cell cycle regulatory proteins essential for the G<sub>2</sub>-M transition, probably due to excessive p53-dependent repression of the associated genes. The suppressive effect of astrin on p53 abundance appears to be mediated by MDM2 because MDM2 protein abundance is severely reduced in astrin-deficient cells, even in the presence of high amounts of mRNA. Further studies are needed to elucidate how exactly astrin regulates the protein abundance of MDM2.</p>
<p>Together, our results show that astrin plays an important role in the DNA damage response by keeping p53 protein abundance in balance during the checkpoint arrest, keeping the cells competent to recover. This concurs with the observation that an oscillating p53 response is compatible with recovery from damage, whereas sustained p53 signaling leads to irreversible arrest and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44"><italic>44</italic></xref>). As a consequence, it is expected that astrin, through its effect on MDM2 and p53 dynamics, will influence cell fate decisions in the context of the DNA damage response.</p>
<p>With the validation of astrin as a regulator of recovery, our comprehensive phosphoproteomic analysis in combination with the siRNA-based functional screen was a successful approach for the identification of new components of the recovery pathway. Our complete data set should serve as a valuable resource for future work investigating the roles that other proteins identified here may have in cell cycle recovery. Furthermore, the strategy developed here could easily be applied to the analysis of other signaling networks involved in different cellular processes.</p>
