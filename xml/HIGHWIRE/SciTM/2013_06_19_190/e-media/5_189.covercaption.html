    <p><b>ONLINE COVER </b><strong>Moving Genomics into the Clinic.</strong> The decreasing cost and increasing speed of next generation sequencing of human genomes has catapulted genomics from the laboratory into the clinic. In a State of the Art Review, <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/189/189sr4.abstract"> McCarthy, McLeod and Ginsburg </a>  examine the successes, challenges and opportunities of genomic medicine. The authors highlight the application of genomics to the diagnosis of rare disorders, risk assessment in healthy individuals, for guiding treatment decisions in patients with complex diseases and for tracking infectious disease outbreaks.
